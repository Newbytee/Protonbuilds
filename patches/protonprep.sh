# because they cause wineboot to error on creating a default prefix after compiling:

# obj-wine64$ WINEPREFIX=$PWD/test ./wine64 wineboot
# wine: created the configuration directory '/home/vagrant/build-Proton-5.5-GE-2/obj-wine64/test'
# wine: could not load kernel32.dll, status c000007b

# the reason is because of outdated glibc used in steam runtime:

# <rbernon> GloriousEggroll zf: the issue comes from steamrt eglibc that incorrectly adds a leaf attribute to dlopen, which makes gcc assume the 
# call have no side effects on the current translation unit and, and makes it optimize some global assignments around it that are normally used by wine to track the outcome of the load
# <rbernon> other / more recent glibc do not have leaf attributes on dlopen, so it's probably an eglibc bug, but it's still a bit hard to workaround
